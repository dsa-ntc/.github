The DSA National Tech Committee (NTC) is a collection of volunteer tech workers
from across the country. We research and implement tech solutions to meet the
various needs of DSAâ€™s national leadership and local chapters.

We are actively searching for DSA member-contributors with a wide range of
skills in web development and design, as well as organizers and product
managers. To get involved, check out some of our work below and then [join
